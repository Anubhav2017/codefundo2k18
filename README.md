# Microsoft codefundo++

## Team Name
# Bohemians

# Problem Statement:
* We need to make a cloud based application which will focus on saving lives from Natural Disasters .The problem focuses on having the maximum effect prior to the calamity hitting .And how to convey this message to the maximum people in a region.
The predictions should be accurate and must be a relatively good forecast to prevent unnecessary hassles and inconvenience to our clients.

# Our Idea for codefundo++
* Users register using their mobile numbers and E-mail address (not mandatory).
* Users can follow the updates of any particular calamity by subscribing to it.
* A feature in which users can report by some means (message or by uploading images) on the calamity.
* Cross check the information reported by the user, using image processing and then send them to server.
* Send alerts and preventive measures through SMS or alarms to users that are registered and around a particular region of calamity hit.
* Prioritize the user reports according to the rating of users
* Prioritize the natural calamities according to the impact of loss possible.
* An additional feature that users can use to forward our updates / messages to other people in his/her contacts.
* For regions which have previously experienced disasters and the management was poor, we will present optimized solutions to the city such that they can handle it better
Example: In flood managements relief camps are sometimes set up in locations quite far from each other.We aim to tackle this problem by creating a network of proposed relief camps that covers region densely populated as well as maintain some form of connectivity channel between them. 

# Technologies and Implementation
* Android to build the application
* Image Processing to validate the correct images
* Language Translation API 
* Database (to store information of users)
* Dynamic Chat Box (to subscribe for any updates of a particular calamity) 
* Location based API (to track users current location)

# Economical
* To predict the density of people to be affected.
Ex: If case there was more than one damage in nearby cities, then to send the required number of helpline facilities to each so as to reduce the wastage of facilities and ensure that every individual would receive required help.

Example: Floods 
One of the primary reasons is that people do not pay heed to the weather forecasts and calamities happen.
We aim to tackle this problem by raising user awarenesses and sending images of calamities that have already take place in some parts of the world based on similar predictions. This would instill fear and awareness of calamities among users.
We would achieve this communication using social media, posting images and reports to our users(all after making the our final predictions.)
