# Problem Statement:
* We need to make a cloud based application which will focus on saving lives from Natural Disasters .The problem focuses on having the maximum effect prior to the calamity hitting .And how to convey this message to the maximum people in a region.
The predictions should be accurate and must be a relatively good forecast to prevent unnecessary hassles and inconvenience to our clients.

# Features of our App
* Users have to register using their phone number and E-mail ID(not mandatory).
* Users can follow the updates related to a particular type of calamity by subscribing to its channel.
* Our app sports a feature in which users can report some mishappening using a/an image/video/message and share it with the community.
* Before being shared, the information reported by the user is cross-checked using image processing and then sent to a server.
* Alerts and preventive measures are sent through SMS to users that are registered around the region hit by the calamity.
* Prioritize the user's reports according to the rating of users.
* Prioritize the natural calamities in order of their potential impact.
* Users can forward updates/alerts to their near and dear ones directly through the app.
* For regions which have previously experienced disasters and the management was poor, we will present optimized solutions for better situation handling.
Example: In flood managements relief camps are sometimes set up in locations quite far from each other.We aim to tackle this problem by creating a network of proposed relief camps that covers region densely populated as well as maintain some form of connectivity channel between them. 

# Technologies and Implementation
* Android Studio is used to build the application
* Image Processing to validate the correct images.
* Language Translation API.
* MySQL to store data.
* Dynamic Chat Box (to subscribe for any updates of a particular calamity) 
* Location based API (to track users current location)

# Economical
* The supply of rescue facilities/aid is optimized 
Ex: In case multiple locations are affected by a calamity, by evaluating parameters such as population density, infrastructure,etc. the appropriate amount of rescue facilities/relief is provided to every location in order to ensure that the facilities are utilized most efficiently.

# Extras 
One of the primary reasons which cause major impact during a calamity, is that people do not pay heed to the weather forecasts and calamities happen.
We aim to tackle this problem by increasing user awarenesses, by sending images of calamities that have already taken place based on similar predictions. This would instill fear and awareness of calamities among users.
We would achieve this communication using social media, posting images and reports to our users(all after making the our final predictions.)
